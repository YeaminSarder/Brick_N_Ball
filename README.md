Brick-N-Ball 🧱⚾

   A simple 2D brick-breaking game built with C and OpenGL (GLUT). 
   Break all the bricks using a bouncing ball and control the paddle with arrow keys.


Features:

   Classic brick-breaker gameplay.

   Paddle controlled with Left and Right arrow keys.

   Ball bounces off walls, paddle, and bricks.

   Game restarts automatically when the ball falls below the paddle.

   Colorful bricks and smooth ball movement.


Gameplay:

   Use LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to move the paddle.

   Press an arrow key to start the ball movement.

   Destroy all the bricks by hitting them with the ball.

   If the ball falls below the paddle, the game will restart after a short delay.

   Enjoy the colorful bouncing ball and bricks!
